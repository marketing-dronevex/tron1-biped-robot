# TRON1 Multi-Modal Biped Robot

TRON1 is a humanoid robot that has a bipedal design, designed to show the capabilities of bipedal locomotion, stability, and interaction with the environment like humans do. It will be used as a platform for researchers to test bipedal locomotion and develop artificial intelligence.

## Overview

Biped robots are a major area of research and development within the robotic industry, and this robot will assist researchers with developing new technologies to help create robots that are capable of navigating human environments. The TRON1 robot will focus on locomotion and balance; therefore, providing researchers opportunities to study the actual motion of bipedal humanoid robots in real-life situations.

## Major Concepts

- Bipedal Locomotion and Balance
- Multi-Modal Interaction (Motion, Perception, and Control)
- Humanoid Robotic Research Platform
- AI and Robotics Research
- Education and Research Applications

## Applications

The TRON1 can be used for:

- Research and Development
- Educational Purposes
- Bipedal Locomotion
- Robotic Motion Control Testing
- Human-Like Robotic Motion Research
- Academic Demonstrations / Lab Exercises

## Project's Features

This repository will serve as documentation and an overview of the capabilities of the TRON1 robot, and provide a basis for future work or experiments.

(The project does not include any proprietary code or hardware designs.)
